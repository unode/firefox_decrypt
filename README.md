### Firefox Decrypt

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/unode/firefox_decrypt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/unode/firefox_decrypt) [![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/d9b714c5d195dd9e7582e8cd6f463982/m/master "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/byKey/d9b714c5d195dd9e7582e8cd6f463982)

**The master branch is unstable during migration to Python 3.**  

If you must use Python 2, please try [Firefox Decrypt 0.7.0](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt/releases/tag/0.7.0).  

If you encounter a problem, try the latest [release](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt/releases) or check open issues for ongoing work.

#### About

**Firefox Decrypt** is a tool to extract passwords from profiles of Mozilla (Fire/Water)fox™, Thunderbird®, SeaMonkey® and some derivates.

It can be used to recover passwords from a profile protected by a Master Password as long as the latter is known.
If a profile is not protected by a Master Password, a password will still be requested but can be left blank.

This tool also allows to perform a dictionary attack on the Master Password.

This script is written in Python and is compatible with versions ~~2.7+~~ (last is [0.7.0](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt/releases/tag/0.7.0)) and 3.6+. On Windows, only Python 3 is supported.

Additionally, it requires access to libnss3 which is included with Firefox and
Thunderbird, although depending on system configuration, the script may fail to
locate the library or may load an incorrect/incompatible version.

Alternatively, you can install libnss3 (Debian/Ubuntu) or nss (Arch/Gentoo/…).
libnss3 is part of https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS

If you need to decode passwords from Firefox 3 or older, this is not officially supported but a patch exists in [this pull request](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt/pull/36).


#### Usage

Run:

```
python firefox_decrypt.py
```

The tool will present a numbered list of profiles. Enter the relevant number. 

Then, a prompt to enter the *master password* for the profile: 

- if no password was set, enter nothing – simply key <kbd>Return</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd>
- if a password was set and is known, enter it
- if a password was set and is no longer known, you can not proceed

#### Advanced usage

If your profiles are at an unusual path, you can call the script with:

```
python firefox_decrypt.py /folder/containing/profiles.ini/
```

If you don't want to display all passwords on the screen you can use:

```
python firefox_decrypt.py | grep -C2 keyword
```
where `keyword` is part of the expected output (URL, username, email, password …)

Since version **0.7.0** passwords may be exported in CSV format using the `--format` flag.

```
python firefox_decrypt.py --format csv
```

Additionally, `--delimiter` and `--quotechar` flags can specify which characters to use as delimiters and quote characters in the CSV output.

Since version **0.4** it is possible to export stored passwords to *pass* from <http://passwordstore.org/>. To do so, use:

```
python firefox_decrypt.py --export-pass
```

and **all** existing passwords will be exported after the pattern `web/<address>[:<port>]` unless multiple credentials exist for the same website in which case `/<login>` is appended. The username will be on a second line.

To prefix the username with `login: ` for compatibility with the [browserpass](https://github.com/dannyvankooten/browserpass) extension, you can use:
```
python firefox_decrypt.py --export-pass --pass-compat browserpass
```

There is currently no way to selectively export passwords.

Exporting will overwrite existing passwords without warning. Ensure you have a backup or are using the `pass git` functionality.

Starting with version **0.5.2** it is now possible to use a non-interactive mode which bypasses all prompts, including profile choice and master password. Use it with `-n/--no-interactive`. Indicate your profile choice by passing `-c/--choice N` where N is the number of the profile you wish to decrypt (starting from **1**).

You can list all available profiles with `-l/--list` (to stdout).

Your master password is read from stdin.

    $ python firefox_decrypt.py --list
    1 -> l1u1xh65.default
    2 -> vuhdnx5b.YouTube
    3 -> 1d8vcool.newdefault
    4 -> ekof2ces.SEdu
    5 -> 8a52xmtt.Fresh

    $ read -sp "Master Password: " PASSWORD
    Master Password:

    $ echo $PASSWORD | python firefox_decrypt.py --no-interactive --choice 4
    Website:   https://login.example.com
    Username: 'john.doe'
    Password: '1n53cur3'

    Website:   https://example.org
    Username: 'max.mustermann'
    Password: 'Passwort1234'

    Website:   https://github.com
    Username: 'octocat'
    Password: 'qJZo6FduRcHw'

    [...snip...]

    $ echo $PASSWORD | python firefox_decrypt.py -nc 1
    Website:   https://git-scm.com
    Username: 'foo'
    Password: 'bar'

    Website:   https://gitlab.com
    Username: 'whatdoesthefoxsay'
    Password: 'w00fw00f'

    [...snip...]

    $ # Unset Password
    $ PASSWORD=

Alternatively, you can provide a wordlist of master passwords for a dictionary attack.

    $ python firefox_decrypt.py -w passwords.lst l1u1xh65.default

#### Troubleshooting

If a problem occurs, please try `firefox_decrypt` in high verbosity mode by calling it with:

```
python firefox_decrypt.py -vvv
```

If the output does not help you to identify the cause and a solution to the problem, file a bug report including the verbose output. **Beware**:  

- your profile password, as well as other passwords, may be visible in the output – so **please remove any sensitive data** before sharing the output.


##### Windows

Both Python and Firefox must be either 32-bit or 64-bit.  

If you mix architectures the code will fail. More information on issue [#8](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt/issues/8).

##### Darwin/macOS

If you get the error described in [#14](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt/issues/14) when loading `libnss3`, consider installing `nss` using brew or an alternative package manager.

#### Testing

If you wish to run the test suite locally, chdir into `tests/` and run `./run_all`

If any test fails on your system, please ensure `libnss` is installed.

If tests continue to fail, re-run with `./run_all -v` then please file a bug report including: 

- the output
- information about your system (e.g. Linux distribution, version of libnss/firefox …). 

It is much appreciated.
